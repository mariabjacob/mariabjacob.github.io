Like every other overachieving Indian girl who scored a 100 in biology, I thought becoming a doctor was the only way to "heal the world". But along the way, I realized—I didn’t just want the white coat. I wanted the science behind it.

At first, pharmacology felt like a detour, but it turned out to be exactly the foundation I needed. I learned how drugs work, how to make them, test them, and even model them computationally. Then, during a research exchange at Ulster University, I discovered translational and precision medicine—where the science behind drug discovery meets the patient’s bedside. That changed everything.

The pandemic made things even clearer. As a front-line worker, I saw firsthand how limited our treatments are, especially for neurological disorders. My research projects—spanning depression, Parkinson’s, dermatitis, and cancer—all made me obsess over some fundamental questions: How do we fix broken circuits instead of just masking symptoms? Why do so many drugs excel in vitro yet fail in vivo? The Bayer's group funded my work, and I did some additional training in CRISPR, sequencing, and omics to identify biomarkers for male infertility. Suddenly, I wasn’t just studying drugs—I was also mapping the roots of the disease they treat.

Now? I’m chasing a PhD to do exactly that: break down dysfunctional circuits, find better targets, optimize drug delivery and push science closer to real-world impactful therapies for patients. I once thought I needed a white coat to make a difference—turns out, I just need a lab to wear it in.
